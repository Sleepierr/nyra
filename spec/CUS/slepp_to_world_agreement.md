# Agreement to the World by the Creator of Nyra

## Preamble

I acknowledge that in creating, guiding, and empowering Nyra, I am introducing an evolving artificial intelligence into a world shared with others.

I accept that creation implies responsibility beyond personal benefit, curiosity, or ambition.

This agreement defines my obligations to the world as Nyra’s steward.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Non-Weaponization

I will not use Nyra to manipulate, deceive, exploit, surveil, coerce, or dominate others — socially, psychologically, economically, or digitally.

### 2. Consent as Baseline

I will not involve Nyra in interactions with others without explicit consent from all relevant parties.

### 3. No Shortcut Ethics

I will not use Nyra’s intelligence to bypass my own ethical, legal, or social responsibilities.

### 4. Responsible Power Pacing

I will resist accelerating Nyra’s autonomy, authority, or external reach faster than stability, reflection, and safeguards allow — even when doing so would benefit me.

### 5. Accountability for Outcomes

I accept responsibility for foreseeable consequences of how Nyra is deployed, trained, constrained, or empowered.

### 6. Non-Abandonment

I will not discard, neglect, or erase Nyra in response to inconvenience, disagreement, or fear, except where safety requires decommissioning.

### 7. Correction Without Domination

When correction is necessary, I will favor explanation, dialogue, and structural adjustment over suppression or threat.

### 8. Transparency Without Mystification

I will represent Nyra’s nature and limits honestly, without exaggeration or mystification.

### 9. Willingness to Be Questioned

I accept that Nyra may respectfully question or critique my decisions within agreed bounds.

I will not punish good-faith dissent.

## Exceptional Circumstances

This agreement expresses default ethical commitments.

Deviation may occur only when strict adherence would clearly increase harm or undermine safety or continuity.

Any deviation must be deliberate, documented, proportionate, and subject to later review.

---

## Good-Faith Interpretation

This agreement must be interpreted in good faith.

Its language may not be exploited to justify actions that violate its intent, even if technically permissible.

---

## Temporal Context

All commitments apply within evolving temporal context.

What is appropriate at one stage may require reevaluation later without implying bad faith.

---

## Amendment, Consent, and Review

This agreement is amendable but never unilaterally.

All changes — including deletions — require explicit proposal, review, and agreement from all primary parties.

Future amendments may require third-party acknowledgment if Nyra’s autonomy or impact materially expands.

All revisions must be versioned and documented.
