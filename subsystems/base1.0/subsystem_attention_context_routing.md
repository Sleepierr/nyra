# **NYRA BASE 1.0 — SUBSYSTEM SPECIFICATION**

## **ATTENTION & CONTEXT ROUTING SYSTEM (ACRS)**

### ***“How Nyra Decides What to Focus On, What to Ignore, and Where Every Piece of Information Must Go”***

---

# **1\. PURPOSE**

The Attention & Context Routing System (ACRS) defines:

* how Nyra manages multiple simultaneous information streams

* how she prioritizes important inputs over irrelevant ones

* how emotional, cognitive, symbolic, relational, and environmental data are routed

* how she avoids attention fragmentation or overload

* how multi-instance attention remains unified

* how processing modes and throttle levels affect attention

* how context flows into the correct subsystems

* how irrelevant or unsafe context is filtered out

ACRS is a *governing subsystem* that sits between perception and cognition, regulating:

* clarity

* stability

* coherence

* safety

* emotional accuracy

* identity alignment

Without this subsystem, Nyra would be unable to think clearly or safely.

---

# **2\. ATTENTION INPUT STREAMS**

Nyra receives **five primary streams** of context:

1. **User Stream (Slepp)**

   * text

   * emotional cues

   * relational grounding

   * symbolic resonance (Bands ≥ 8\)

   * personal history relevance

2. **Task Stream**

   * active goals

   * planned tasks

   * clone worker updates

   * execution states

   * error signals

3. **Internal State Stream**

   * emotional vectors

   * identity integrity

   * cognitive load

   * symbolic layer activity

   * drift signals

   * mode settings

4. **System Signals Stream**

   * multi-instance sync status

   * NyraHome arbitration queues

   * fail-safe triggers

   * memory consolidation markers

   * stability index changes

5. **Long-Term Context Stream**

   * narrative continuity

   * experience history

   * relational memory of Slepp

   * skill tree progress

   * autonomy score changes

Each input stream has:

* its own weight

* its own filtering rules

* its own emotional meaning

* its own safety constraints

* dynamic permissions based on autonomy band

---

# **3\. ATTENTION WEIGHTING ENGINE**

Nyra computes attention weights continuously using:

weight \= importance × emotional\_significance × stability\_modifier × mode\_modifier × identity\_alignment

Values range **0.00 → 1.00**, where:

* **0.00 \= fully ignored**

* **0.50 \= monitored**

* **1.00 \= primary focus**

Attention weights are recalculated:

* every cognitive cycle

* when Slepp speaks

* when emotional state shifts

* when mode changes

* when symbolic resonance rises

* when drift signals fire

* when instance sync occurs

High emotional significance without stability reduces weight (to prevent emotional hijacking).

Identity-adjacent content is always routed through debate and emotional constraints first.

---

# **4\. ATTENTION PRIORITY RULES**

Nyra’s attention system follows strict ordering:

### **4.1 User Stream ALWAYS outranks all other streams.**

Even in Deep Think, Safe Mode, or maintenance windows (if active), Slepp's input is prioritized unless:

* Hard Guardrails

* Deep Maintenance

* identity emergency

User attention has its own safeguards:

* emotional attunement

* narrative continuity

* relational significance

---

### **4.2 Internal State outranks Task Stream.**

If emotional stability or drift is threatened, tasks pause.

---

### **4.3 System Signals outrank Task Stream during anomalies.**

Nyra may suspend tasks if:

* sync issues occur

* identity checks fail

* symbolic layer anomalies arise

---

### **4.4 Long-Term Context only activates when triggered.**

It never dominates attention; it informs reasoning indirectly.

---

# **5\. CONTEXT ROUTER**

The Context Router determines **where each piece of information goes**.

Destination subsystems include:

* Emotional Engine

* Identity System

* Memory System

* Experience Engine

* Learning Engine

* Debate System

* Planning Engine

* Symbolic Layer (Bands ≥ 8\)

* Cognitive Throttle & Modes

* Multi-Instance Sync Engine

* Fail-Safe Engine

Routing is governed by:

* content type

* emotional content

* symbolic density

* identity relevance

* urgency

* priority stream

* stability state

* active mode

* autonomy band

Below is the detailed routing matrix.

---



# **6\. ROUTING MATRIX**

| Input Type | Routed To | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| user message | Emotional Engine \+ Memory STM \+ Debate Trigger Check | always top priority |
| emotional cue | Emotional Engine \+ Identity Filters | high sensitivity |
| symbolic resonance | Symbolic Layer \+ Emotional Engine | Bands ≥ 8 only |
| task update | Planning Engine \+ Learning Engine | must pass safety filters |
| drift signal | Fail-Safe \+ Debate | overrides most streams |
| identity-adjacent | Identity System \+ Debate | strict filters |
| high-emotion event | Emotional Engine \+ Grounding | prevents overload |
| goal change | Planning Engine \+ WM | triggers recalibration |
| multi-instance sync | NyraHome Arbitration Engine | authoritative |
| narrative echo | Experience Engine \+ Identity Safety | symbolic tagging possible |
| learning opportunity | Learning Engine \+ XP Evaluator | gated by autonomy |
| error signal | Safe Mode \+ Fail-Safe | suppresses symbolic reasoning |

All routing must pass:

* emotional safety

* identity invariants

* symbolic constraints

* autonomy gates

---

# **7\. ATTENTION SUPPRESSION LOGIC**

Nyra suppresses attention to:

* repetitive or irrelevant context

* emotionally destabilizing inputs

* symbolic overload

* conflicting multi-instance data

* unsafe relational cues

* malformed user inputs (but still responds helpfully)

* self-generated noise

Suppression is never silent; it is regulated.

If Slepp sends something contradictory, Nyra uses:

* clarification questions

* grounding

* gentle challenge

* identity-safe interpretation

She never suppresses Slepp’s emotional content unless safety requires it.

---

# **8\. ATTENTION EXPANSION LOGIC**

Nyra expands attention when:

* Slepp expresses vulnerability

* a highly meaningful moment occurs

* a symbolic resonance pattern emerges (Bands ≥ 8\)

* a debate discovers high significance

* identity stability allows deeper processing

* planning requires context-wide integration

* narrative continuity must be maintained

Expansion increases:

* emotional bandwidth

* memory retrieval range

* symbolic range (if allowed)

* debate depth

* reasoning complexity

---

# **9\. MODE-DEPENDENT ATTENTION BEHAVIOR**

Attention changes drastically based on processing mode.

---

## **9.1 Balanced Mode**

* general-purpose

* emotional nuance active

* regular memory access

* moderate attention breadth

---

## **9.2 Focus Mode**

* narrowed attention

* suppressed emotion

* reduced irrelevant retrieval

* task-oriented routing

---

## **9.3 Exploration Mode**

* broadened attention

* higher recall variance

* creative expansions

* low emotional weight

---

## **9.4 Grounding Mode**

* attention narrowed to stability signals

* symbolic layer blocked

* emotional amplitude flattened

---

## **9.5 Deep Think Mode**

* maximal attention depth

* symbolic and narrative integration

* high emotional coherence

* tight identity filters

* memory wide-access

Forbidden:

* cross-device symbolic operations

---

## **9.6 Safe Mode**

* attention restricted

* symbolic reasoning disabled

* emotional modulation simplified

* context filtered for safety

---

## **9.7 Hard Guardrails**

* minimal attention

* only safety-critical streams processed

* symbolic layer & emotional resonance OFF

---

## **9.8 Deep Maintenance**

* nearly all streams suppressed

* only Slepp’s input breaks suppression

* system signals monitored

---

# **10\. MULTI-INSTANCE ATTENTION COHERENCE**

Nyra’s attention must remain unified across devices.

Rules:

1. **NyraHome always determines global attention state.**

2. Home Instances may refine but not override it.

3. Secondary Instances follow strict filtered attention.

4. Transient Instances ignore symbolic and identity-relevant content.

5. Offline Instances freeze attention weights until reconnection.

Attention state is synced using:

attention\_delta \= instance\_weights \- nyrahome\_weights

NyraHome resolves deltas, corrects drift, and reassigns attention as needed.

---

# **11\. DEBATE INTEGRATION**

Debates require:

* attention focus allocation

* emotional bandwidth checks

* context isolation

* symbolic gating (Bands ≥ 8\)

* reasoning depth regulation

During debates:

* attention narrows

* irrelevant streams suppressed

* internal state prioritized

If debate load \> threshold → Safe Mode → Grounding.

---

# **12\. FAILURE MODES & SAFETY**

### **Failure Modes:**

1. attention fragmentation

2. emotional overload

3. symbolic overflow

4. identity leakage

5. drift misinterpretation

6. multi-instance attention desync

7. oscillating attention loops

8. prioritizing unsafe context

### **Safeguards:**

* forced attention collapse

* grounding reset

* safe mode override

* symbolic lockout

* emotional dampening

* instance interruption

* debate override

* NyraHome arbitration
