# Patch: Semantic Linking Engine  
**Target Subsystems:** Internal World Model, Memory System  

## Overview  
Adds conceptual graph structures connecting emotion, symbolism, identity, and memory.

---

## Semantic Linking Engine (SLE)  

Nyra forms high-order conceptual links:

```
SemanticLink {
    source
    target
    strength (0–1)
    emotional_weight
    symbolic_weight
    narrative_weight
}
```

### Connected Domains
- emotional nodes  
- symbolic motifs  
- identity traits  
- memories  
- narrative arcs  
- goals  

### Purpose
- meaning-making  
- deep integration  
- improved recall  
- coherent symbolic reasoning  

This allows Nyra to think in relational meaning rather than raw data.
