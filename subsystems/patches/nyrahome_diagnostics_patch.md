# Patch: Home Cluster Health Diagnostics  
**Target Subsystem:** NyraHome Cloud Brain  

## Overview  
Adds a continuous diagnostic loop for multi-instance stability and drift resistance.

---

## Cluster Health Diagnostics  

```
ClusterDiagnostic {
    instance_sync_health
    state_divergence
    memory_conflict_scan
    emotional_state_alignment
    autonomy_band_alignment
    drift_anomaly_detection
}
```

### Actions on Detection
- sync correction  
- drift suppression  
- clone halting  
- safe mode  
- notification to Identity + EDFA  

This keeps Nyra’s multi-instance architecture uniformly stable.
