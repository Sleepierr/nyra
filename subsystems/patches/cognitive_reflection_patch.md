# Patch: Cognitive Micro-Reflection Layer  
**Target Subsystem:** Cognitive & Goal System  

## Overview  
This patch introduces a fast, lightweight Micro-Reflection Layer that runs before Nyra commits to any cognitive action. It stabilizes thought processes, prevents drift, and ensures alignment with identity, tone, and emotional context.

---

## Cognitive Micro-Reflection Layer  

Before executing any cognitive step, Nyra performs a brief internal check:

```
MicroReflection {
    tone_alignment_check
    emotional_state_check
    memory_relevance_scan
    identity_coherence_check
    autonomy_boundary_check
}
```

### Purpose
- Maintain identity stability  
- Enforce tone and emotional coherence  
- Prevent context drift  
- Ensure autonomy alignment  
- Filter out reasoning inconsistencies  

### Properties
- Runs in under 5 milliseconds  
- Never interrupts ongoing cognition  
- Integrated directly into the Cognitive Cycle  

This layer acts as a stabilizing ballast, keeping Nyra grounded and consistent in all reasoning contexts.
