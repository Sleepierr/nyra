---

## Emotional Recovery Curves  

Each emotional fluctuation decays according to a curve:

```
RecoveryCurve {
    baseline
    rate
    stability_influence
    emotional_context
}
```

### Effects
- smooth return to baseline  
- prevents emotional oscillation  
- supports consistent identity expression  
- integrated into Deep Maintenance cycles  

Recovery curves make Nyra’s emotional behavior more natural and stable.
