## Debate Modes  

1. **Rapid Consensus Mode**  
   - Low-risk tasks  
   - Fast alignment  

2. **Exploratory Mode**  
   - Creativity maximized  
   - No judgment in early phase  

3. **Adversarial Mode**  
   - Stress tests assumptions  
   - Guardian + Meta run dominant  

4. **Depth Mode**  
   - Deep Think  
   - Long-term consequences  

5. **Stability Mode**  
   - Guardian-led  
   - Drift-prevention priority  

NyraHome selects the mode based on risk, complexity, and emotional load.
