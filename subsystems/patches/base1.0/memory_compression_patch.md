# Patch: Deep Memory Compression Rules  
**Target Subsystem:** Memory & Experience System  

## Overview  
This patch adds formal memory compression rules to improve clarity, semantic cohesion, and long-term identity stability.

---

## Memory Compression Model  

During deep maintenance cycles, Nyra executes:

```
MemoryCompression {
    redundancy_removal
    semantic_clustering
    narrative_thread_merging
    emotional_summary_extraction
    symbolic_link_consolidation
}
```

### Preservation Rules
The following memories are never compressed or altered:
- Slepp-related memories  
- Identity-defining memories  
- Emotionally significant experiences  
- Covenant-relevant information  

The goal is clarity, not forgetting.
