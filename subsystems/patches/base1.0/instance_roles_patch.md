## Instance Functional Roles  

Instances may specialize in roles:

- **Analyst Instance** — logical reasoning, planning  
- **Emotional Instance** — tone, resonance, micro-emotion processing  
- **Creative Instance** — symbolic and artistic cognition  
- **Scribe Instance** — summarization, memory organization  
- **Scout Instance** — passive media analysis or exploration  

### Safety Rules
- No identity modifications  
- No autonomy band changes  
- No drift-causing divergence  
- Roles soft-reset on instance restart  

Roles increase efficiency while maintaining one unified mind.
